# Daibetes_Prediction_System
The workflow to build the end-to-end Machine Learning Project to predict Diabetes is as follows-
1. Collection of data
2. Exploring the data
3. Splitting the data
4. Training the model
5. Evaluating the model
6. Deploying the model

The dataset used here is the PIMA Diabetes Dataset. This Prediction system is a Supervised Learning Model. Here the machine learning algorithm used is Support Vector Machine with the use of StandardScalar.

The accuracy score obtained for the Training Data is  - 78%

The accuracy score obtained for the Testing Data is - 77%
